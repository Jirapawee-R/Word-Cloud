# Word-Cloud
This is the code to construct a word cloud from a ".txt" document.
A word cloud (a.k.a tag cloud) is a simple visualization of data, in which words are shown in varying sizes depending on how often they appear in your data. I have uploaded a simple code to construct the Word Cloud for any document in the".txt" format. I am also attaching the ".txt" file that I had used for the results of this Word Cloud - "alice.txt."
