# Word-Cloud
This is the code to construct a word cloud from a ".csv" document.
A word cloud (a.k.a tag cloud) is a simple visualization of data, in which words are shown in varying sizes depending on how often they appear in your data. I have uploaded a simple code to construct the Word Cloud using the reviews of a very popular song of Shakira published in youtube. I am also attaching the data file that I had used for the results of this Word Cloud - "Youtube05-Shakira.csv"
